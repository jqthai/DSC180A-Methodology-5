1. The most interesting thing I learned this quarter regarded GINs and how they used isomorphism tests to determine whether two graphs are identical. The way it is done was really unique to me because it was more powerful in this specific task that other neural networks were average at.

2. A potential investigation I'd like to pursue in my Quarter 2 project is applying interpretability to neural networks. Using multiple online packages from PyTorch and other methods that we've learned, I want to make the results from neural networks understandable as they aren't very intuitive innately.

3. A potential change I'd take in the approach of my Quarter 1 project is to apply more variations in the GNNs I tested - whether it be different amount of layers or activation functions. I'd be able to get a more robust understanding of what they actually do and how they impact the results. 

4. I would also be interested in using better visualization techniques in my network visualizations to make it more clear. I'd also want to apply the interpretability packages to multiple different GNNs and see how they fare on the same datasets and how the varying results alter the explanation it provides.
